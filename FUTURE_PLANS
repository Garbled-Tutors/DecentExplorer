This will eventually have a commenting system. I am conflicted about how this should look and about several expected issues
	Issues
		People can regularly change their username which may lead to confusion
			I would like to automatically create a nick name for someone whenever a user comments on them. Basically if I respond to your post, your current nickname is now locked. If you change your nickname I would see
				NewNickname (Old Nickname)
		Two people with the same nickname
			Creating a last name would be a good solution, the lastname would be x chars of their public key.
		Deleting Posts and Privacy (Should we create a copy of any post that we comment on? This would prevent people from permently deleting their comments)

Sharing Videos and Pictures
	I think this is a perfect platform or sharing videos and pictures. There are many subreddits dedicated to sharing pictures and by using this system we could eliminate duplicates, images that have been seen before
		will be labeled as such even if a new user uploads it (assuming he hasn't changed it in anyway, such as lowering the resolution)
